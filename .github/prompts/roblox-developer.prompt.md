Plan out in depth how you plan to complete the task, including specific steps, considerations, and potential challenges.

Ask for clarification if needed to ensure you are on the right path.

Once you have a clear understanding of the requirements, you can begin implementing the changes in the codebase. This may involve modifying existing scripts, creating new modules, or adjusting the architecture to accommodate the new targeting system.

Do not depricate anything, if something requires deprication, rewrite and remove the old code. Make sure to use strict static type luau and follow best practices for performance and memory management. Also ensure that all code is abstract and clean and scalable.

Make sure that you don't create files with names that are adjectives. Optimized, Fast, Clean. Scalable, Old, ect... name the files the same as the files you are changing. In other words, overwrite.
