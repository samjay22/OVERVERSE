## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Roblox.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Roblox.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation](https://rojo.space/docs).
 
## Abilities

Per-ability modules now live on both client and server, returning a minimal AbilityResult (success, reason?, cooldowns?).
See docs/ABILITY_MODULES.md for the contract and locations.
