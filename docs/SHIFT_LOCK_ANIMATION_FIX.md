# Shift Lock Animation Coordination Fix

## Problem
The shift lock system was interfering with character animations during turning movements due to:

1. **Continuous CFrame manipulation**: The shift lock system was updating the character's CFrame every `RenderStepped` frame
2. **AutoRotate conflicts**: Setting `Humanoid.AutoRotate = false` removed Roblox's built-in character rotation
3. **Movement detection issues**: Manual rotation affected `Humanoid.MoveDirection` calculations in the animation system

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Character Rotation Logic
- **Movement-aware rotation**: Reduced rotation speed when character is moving to prevent conflicts
- **Movement start delay**: Added a brief delay (`MOVEMENT_ROTATION_DELAY = 0.1`) with minimal rotation when movement begins
- **Grounded state checks**: Only apply immediate rotation when character is not moving or not grounded

### 2. Enhanced Movement Detection
- **Shift lock awareness**: The MovementAnimationHandler now checks `ShiftLockState` to adjust movement detection
- **Adaptive thresholds**: Lower movement threshold when shift lock is active (50% of normal) for better responsiveness
- **Improved back-walking detection**: More reliable detection when shift lock is active

### 3. Movement State Tracking
- **Movement timing**: Track when movement starts to apply appropriate rotation speeds
- **State cleanup**: Reset movement tracking when shift lock is toggled
- **Previous frame tracking**: Store previous movement direction to detect state changes

## Configuration Changes

New configuration option in `ShiftLock.luau`:
```lua
MOVEMENT_ROTATION_DELAY = 0.1 -- Delay before applying rotation when moving
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Smoother animations**: Character rotation no longer fights with animation systems
2. **Better responsiveness**: Animations respond more accurately to movement inputs
3. **Reduced conflicts**: Timing-based approach prevents interference between systems
4. **Maintained functionality**: All shift lock features remain intact while improving animation compatibility

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
- Detecting when movement starts and applying very gentle rotation initially
- Gradually increasing rotation speed after the initial movement delay
- Using different rotation speeds for moving vs. stationary states
- Coordinating between the shift lock and animation systems through shared state

This ensures that animations can properly initialize and play without being disrupted by aggressive character rotation.
